# GoASCII

This is a simple application that converts an image to its ASCII equivalent using the https://paulbourke.net/dataformats/asciiart/ grayscale and the https://github.com/aybabtme/rgbterm module to output the color.

To use it, pass the image as an argument to the executable generated after compilation:

`./GoASCII {image}`
